                <h2>Born from Tragedy, Built for Protection</h2>
                <p>The Dolls Initiative represents Dinah Bons' most recent and innovative institutional project. This pan-European mutual aid network, enabled by technology, was born from tragedy and designed to protect one of Europe's most vulnerable populations: trans migrant sex workers.</p>

                <p>Co-founded with Victoria Maxima Caram and Aryelle Freeman Hopelezz, the initiative's mission is to create a "safe and encrypted network to protect trans sex workers in Europe, preventing our sisters from disappearing without a trace."</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>The Catalyst</h3>
                    <p>The death of their sister Ela was a heartbreak that moved the founders from mourning into motion. For days they fought tirelessly to get her body repatriated, navigating bureaucracy, silence, and indifference.</p>
                    
                    <p>But with the determination of their community and the courage of leaders like Dinah and Maxima, they succeeded. Not just in honoring her death, but in sparking a vision of what must never happen again.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-quote">
                        "The initiative did not emerge in boardrooms, but 'in nightclubs, back kitchens, WhatsApp chats,' from 'mutual survival and urgent need for care when institutions turned their backs.'"

                    <h3>From Pain to Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The catalyst was the death of their sister Ela and the struggle to repatriate her body, a painful experience that ignited the vision of a protection network.</p>
                    
                    <p>From this pain was born "The Dolls Initiative network": a secure, pan-European web of connection, protection, and visibility for trans migrants.</p>
                    
                    <p>This system exists solely to prevent families from losing their daughters without knowledge, to ensure every doll is seen, remembered, and protected.</p>
