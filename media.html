                <p>Bons' activism extends beyond politics and advocacy to include art as a crucial front. As an actress and Creative Strategy Chief for theater company Female Economy, she uses cultural production to explore the same themes of decolonization, gender justice, and intersectionality that drive her political work.</p>
